# Python Framework for Advent Of Code 

## What is Advent Of Code?
Advent of code is a series of coding challenges in the form of an advent calendar : One challenge divided in two parts per day from December 1rst up until December 25th [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)


This is my attempt for 2021 (This was during the end of my first university semester so i did not get very far because of all my exams)

This project was built using my own PythonAoCFramework : https://github.com/william-fecteau/AdventOfCodePythonFramework
